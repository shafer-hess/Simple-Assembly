# Simple-Assembly
Three simple assembly programs coded as an intro to ARM assembly programming

# Program Functionality

Sum Array: User inputs 5 numbers into the terminal and the program will sum the values and print the result to the terminal. Entries are added one value at a time followed by the enter key.

Larger: This program takes two numerical inputs and prints the larger of the two inputs to the terminal. Entries are added one value at a time followed by the enter key

Length: The length program will count the length of a string entered by the user and print the result to the terminal.

# Usage

Move all files to the same directory and navigate to that directory in the terminal. Type 'make' to compile all the necesarry object files. Now typing './program-name' will run the program that you choose.
